Date: 2019-04-18

We have recorded our introductory podcast which we plan to publish through all the usual channels (iTunes, Google Play, etc.) within the next couple of weeks.

In the meantime, [here is a sneak preview of the first Data Nomads podcast](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/datanomads.dev/DataNomads-0000.mp3 "Data Nomads Session 0").

Send us an email at [podcast@datanomads.dev](mailto:podcast@datanomads.dev) if you would like to connect with us and/or subscribe to the ongoing podcast once it is released.
